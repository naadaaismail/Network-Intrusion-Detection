‚òÅÔ∏è Overview

we develop different models and evaluate them by accuracy and recall to not miss any malicious, so we focus 
on high recall of class 1. 
 After evaluation, the best five models are SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and MLP. 
The following step is to build the Stacking algorithm and voting algorithm with hyperparameter and without the 
hyperparameter. 
The champion model was a stacking algorithm (Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM) with default parameters that 
Accuracy equals 80% and recall of 84%. 

üî∏ DataSet

Our dataset is the KISTI+IDS2021-CDMC data, which includes 153,829 IDS alerts labeled as either malicious 
(label: 1) or benign (label: 2). The data is divided into two parts: training data with labels and testing data without 
labels. Data includes a word vector column where every row consists of unbalanced number of nested list and 
each list is 1*100 dimensions. For instance, the first row contains 19 nested lists, but second row has 25. That 
needs to be converted from many nested lists to a single (1 x 100) feature by selecting the maximum value from 
the nested lists inside each row, representing the most important word.


üìñ Getting Started

 Preprocessing :
 
  1- Transformation of data:by selecting the maximum value fromthe nested lists inside each row, representing the most important word.

2- Normalization :using the Minmax Scaler from Sklearn.
